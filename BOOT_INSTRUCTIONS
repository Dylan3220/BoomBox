Download the Rasppbery Pi Imager
  Select the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W Board
  Select the raspberry pi os lite
  Select the sd card as the storage device, make sure everything important is off of the sd card because it will be erased
  Edit the customization settings
    enable ssh
    create a username and password
    input the SSID and the wifi password

Once the imager is done take out the sd card and put it into the raspberry pi

MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN A PLACE WITH GOOD WIFI, NOT YOUR ROOM AT 844 PARK PLACE DIPSHIT

go to your terminal on a laptop connected to the same wifi and type "ssh [your username]@raspberrypi.local" and enter the corresponding password

enter the following commands to install a script from my Github, this script will install all the necessary libraries, alter the config of the pi, and setup all the service files
