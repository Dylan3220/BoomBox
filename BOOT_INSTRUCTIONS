Instructions on how to setup a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W for the Boom Box ... Lets get bumpin baby

Download the Rasppbery Pi Imager
  Select the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W Board
  Select the raspberry pi os lite
  Select the sd card as the storage device, make sure everything important is off of the sd card because it will be erased
  Edit the customization settings
    enable ssh
    create a username and password
    input the SSID and the wifi password

Once the imager is done take out the sd card and put it into the raspberry pi

MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN A PLACE WITH GOOD WIFI, NOT YOUR ROOM AT 844 PARK PLACE DIPSHIT

go to your terminal on a laptop connected to the same wifi and type "ssh [your username]@raspberrypi.local" and enter the corresponding password

enter the following commands to install raspotify (this will turn your device into a spotify connect device), pip, spotipy, and mfrc522

  sudo apt-get -y install curl && curl -sL https://dtcooper.github.io/raspotify/install.sh | sh  
  sudo apt install python3-pip
  pip install spotipy --break-system-packages 
  pip install mfrc522 --break-system-packages

this command may take a while to run, but be patient hoe

enter the following command into bash
  sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt

then make sure the following line is set to off
  dtparam=audio=off
  dtparam=spi=on
  dtparam=i2c_arm=on
  dtparam=i2c=on

and make sure the following dtoverlay is set to hifiberry-digiamp
  dtoverlay=hifiberry-digiamp

then reboot your pi and test the raspotify

type this into your terminal to find the location of the spotipy library
  pip show spotipy

navigate to the oauth2.py file in the spotipy library go into the nano editor, navigate to line 372

navigate to the Spotify0Auth class and the get_authorize_url definition, add the following lines just before the return statement

  url = f"{self.OAUTH_AUTHORIZE_URL}?{urlparams}"
  print(f"Full Authorization URL: {url}")

then sype the following command to open a text editor and create a file called downtown.sh, when you run this file it will download the spotify_script_2.py and dylan_spotify.service file from this repo onto your raspberry pi

sudo wget -O /home/diego/downtown.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dylan3220/BoomBox/main/downtown.sh 


copy the contents of downtown.sh into this file 

  sudo systemctl enable dylan_spotify.service
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
